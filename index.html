  <h1>Hello. I am a Web Developer and Designer.</h1>
  <p>I am a teenager programmer and freelancer. I am from India, and my primary job is to <br>design web sites that look good, do good.</p>

<section id = "why-hire-me">
  <h1 class = "why-heading">Do Good. Look Good. Feel Good.</h1>
  <p>Well, to me, this site is pretty self-explanatory</p>
  <h1 class = "why-heading">Low Costs, High Standards.</h1>
  <p> Get a website for prices as low as 50$<p>
  <h1 class = "why-heading">How was this website made, I hear you ask.</h1>
  <p>First of all, I decided the color scheme.<br>
  Often a very tricky part, colors are a very important element of any site.<br>
  So a monochromatic color scheme was chosen, with three shades of blue.<br>
  Blue, as you may know, is a cooler color, and generally represents comfort and reliabilty.<br>
  And you, my future, or present customer, must be comfortable with me.<br>
  Next came Amber, a complement for blue.<br>
  Also, this website comes with ample of whitespace.<br>
  The layout of this website is also important, and well suited for a responsive design.
